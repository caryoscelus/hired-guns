overview
========

Distant future. Space travel across galaxy (and maybe even into other galaxies,
but that's not really important) is possible thanks to portal technology.
Humanity lives together with several alien races.

technology
==========

Some of tech is either lost or concealed by some groups.

* wormhole-like space portals
* comfortable interplanetary spaceships
* ...

politics
========

Major political entities include few big (controlling more than one planet
system) countries in a state of cold war and Transport Hub, which controls
space portals.

transport hub
-------------

Organization which controls all inter-stellar travel. Initially created as
collaboration effort by many countries, it became a separate entity, which
monopolized all space portals.

empire
------

A classical empire with colonies, strict social hierarchy, personality cult etc.

republic
--------

Supposedly democratic and liberal with, nonetheless, strong, manipulative and
occasionally oppressive government.

ai hivemind
-----------

Staying aside from other conventional human-like countries, there is this
insufficiently explored entity, robot/computer-only territory, which only
communicates with outer world when necessary.

hired guns
==========

That's how mercenaries are called. They are in a legal grey zone: while their
activity is mostly illegal, governments usually close eyes on it, unless their
interests are involved. This is largely because governments themselves like to
use hired guns occasionally.
