=====
style
=====

On the surface, HG looks like a pulp space adventure. However, that doesn't
define it. In fact, it shouldn't be describable by any sole genre: it aims to
blend comedy, drama, adventure, surrealism, horror, mystery, etc. It is thus
quite hard to tell what fits the style and what doesn't.

realism
=======

In terms of laws of nature, some realism should be kept; unnatural things or
behaviour should be explainable (unless there is specific reason to do
otherwise); but other than that characters and societies have full freedom to be
weird.

adventure
=========

Used as a main source of plot advancement.

humor
=====

* subtle is better than bold, though latter has its place too
* parodies are fine as long as they are not dominant
* forth wall shouldn't be actually broken, though occasional subtle hints on it
  are fine

drama
=====

Drama is always welcome, both as means for additional humor effect and actual
serious drama.

moral choices and ambiguity
===========================

Moral choices should be common, sometimes without any 'good' option (or,
perhaps, with one leading to dead end).
